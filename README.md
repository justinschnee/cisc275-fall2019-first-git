1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
 3 Dogs, , an Arraylist of dogs, and a comparator

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?

The comparator constructor call is the Collections.sort() call (new Comparator<Animal>()). 
The class definition is whatever is after the collection.sort so the body of the collection.sort.
